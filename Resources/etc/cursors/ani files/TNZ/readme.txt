Author's decription:

This cursor set features Tiki, the main character of the arcade game "The New Zealand Story" made in 1988 by Taito. Sprites ripped by Yawackhary (Tiki) and Random Talkig Bush (bow, duck...).
I would like to thank Bob Lennon, a french YouTuber who made me discover this game through his video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdUlO1OHuKU/ Retro Lennon Show : The New Zealand Story]. Thanks a lot, Bob, may the P-P-P-P-POWER be with you !
